CS 225 Data Structures Team Contract (ericzc2-srzhu3-sgrover4-ztg2)

## How we plan to counter Communication Issues:

**Meeting Frequency:** We will have at least one meeting every week on Friday 6-7 pm however if there is more work to be done to achieve our goal we will increase the frequency of the meeting and choose a time best that works for everyone based on our team survey (https://doodle.com/poll/fbedtfp54dqbiytc?utm_source=poll&utm_medium=link) and double-check with everyone through discord.

**Positive Communication:** There should be positive communication throughout the discord chats or when communicating because of how working together is a learning experience. There will be mistakes that happen but by helping each other out and being understanding we can be successful in this group project.

**Request For Assistance:** If needed assistance and none of our team members know what to do we will make sure to ask a TA or go to office hours in order to get help for the problem. Otherwise, we will make sure to communicate through discord and emails should get a response before 48 hours.

**How to ensure the environment is respectful:** By making sure we keep each other in check, if someone is extremely disrespectful in the group they will be reported to the course assistant staff because we will try and keep a respectful environment. We will also make sure to have one person who takes notes and is essentially the leader, we can take turns so everyone will be able to experience leading.

## How we plan to counter Collaboration Issues:
	
**Distribution of Work:** In order to distribute work ideally the person who is most skilled or motivated to do the task will take charge, otherwise we will look at the tasks each person has left and assign them to those who aren’t doing as much work as others. If more than one person has an unbalanced workload we can assign them to work with each other to solve a task allowing us to rebalance the workload, essentially we will try and keep a balanced workload between each other.
	
**Time Commitment for each Member:** We plan an estimation of around two to six hours for each person based on the task they have to complete for the project. However if a person is unable to complete a project, and they really tried their absolute best, we will either try and break it down within each other, ask a TA, or see if we can approach the situation in a different light. As a team, our effort will be graded as a team not as an individual therefore it is the team’s responsibility in order to make sure everything has been completed for the week. However, if a person is slacking off and trying to get by through others’ work they will explain their circumstances and if they are unable to explain proper reasoning will be alerted to the course staff.

**Conflict Resolution:** We will try and solve the conflict through logical reasoning and for the optimal success of the group. However, if it’s something that is more minor and for fun, we can accept challenging the other team member to a video game battle (Super Smash/Final Destination 3) as this will allow for bonding time while also solving our minor conflicts.
